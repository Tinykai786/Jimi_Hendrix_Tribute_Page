               <ul> 
                <li>the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace"</li>
                <li>As she slams the door in his drunken face,</li>
                <li>And now he stands outside</li>
                <li>And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</li>
                <li>He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad,</li>
                <li>What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"</li>
                <li>Against the door he leans and starts a scene,</li>
                <li>And his tears fall and burn the garden green</li>
                <li>And so castles made of sand,</li>                     
                <li>Fall in the sea, eventually</li>
                <li>A little Indian brave who before he was ten,</li>
                <li>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends,</li>
                <li>And he built a dream that when he grew up,</li>
                <li>He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief</li>
                <li>Many moons passed and more the dream grew stronger,</li>
                <li>Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song,</li>
                <li>And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,</li>
                <li>Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night</li>
                <li>And so castles made of sand,</li>
                <li>Melts into the sea, eventually</li>
                <li>There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,</li>
                <li>'Cause she was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound</li>
                <li>And she wished and prayed she could stop living,</li>
                <li>So she decided to die</li>                               
                <li>She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled</li>
                <li>"You won't hurt me no more"</li>
                <li>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</li>
                <li>"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"</li>
                <li>And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going</li>
                <li>And so castles made of sand</li>
                <li>Slips into the sea, eventually</li>
               </ul>
